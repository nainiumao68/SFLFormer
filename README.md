# SFLFormer
It's a spatial-frequency layered transformer frameworkc for RGB-T dual-modalities semantic segmentation task. Our network has achieved advanced or SOTA performance on six datasets, including MFNet, PST900, MSRS, FMB, CART, and SUSDataset. The relevant code of the network, including complete model files, training files, and testing files, will be open-sourced subsequently.
